## Validations

All [validations] are set in the Form Schema and all them returns boolean. If it is `true` then your field contain errors otherwise your field is valid.

[validations]:<http://react-jsx-forms.co.in/validations>

Some of the validations are InBuilt like -

- **Validators.required()**
  
       Returns true when field is Empty.

- **Validators.minChar(10)**

       Returns true when field value length is less that limit 10.

- **Validators.maxChar(10)**
       
       Returns true when field exceeds the limit 10.

- **Validators.pattern(/hello/g)**  

       Returns true when Pattern is Not Matched.

- **Validators.matchLength(10)**  
       
       Returns true when field length is not Matched.

- **Validators.matchStringText(Hello)**  
       
       Returns true when field value(string) is not equal to "Hello".

- **Validators.matchNumText(10000)**  
       
       Returns true when field value(string) is not equal to `10000`.



You can also **[Compose]** your OWN VALIDATION with **`Validators.compose()`**.
